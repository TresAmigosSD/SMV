 *
 * Depends on the data types of the columns, Edd summary method will perform different
 * statistics.
 *
 * The `histogram` method takes a group of `HistColumn` as parameters.
 * Or when a group of `String` as the column names are given, it will use the default `HistColumn`
 * parameters.
 * Two types of `HistColumn`s are supported
 *  - [[org.tresamigos.smv.edd.Hist]]
 *  - [[org.tresamigos.smv.edd.AmtHist]]
 *
 * The `eddShow` method will print report to the console, `saveReport` will save report as `RDD[String]`,
 * The strings are JSON strings.
