/**
 * implement the cube/rollup operations on a given SRDD and a set of columns.
 * See http://joshualande.com/cube-rollup-pig-data-science/ for the pig implementation.
 * Rather than using nulls as the pig version, a sentinel value of "*" will be used
 *
 * Since Spark 1.4, rollup and cube methods were supported in Spark as method on DF.
 * However there are two limitations,
 * - Can't apply on groupbed data, so that can't have other keys
 * - Can't specify sentinel string other than null. Since null always handeled differently
 *   in other DF steps, it's way more convenience to use "*" as the sentinel string insteald of null
